# Four Pillars
--
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
--

--
# Abstraction

- abstraction is focus on essential quailites of an item <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- form over substance <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- interfaces

--
# Polymorphism
--

> an object or function can take many different forms

--
# Inheritance

> the idea that we pass along attributes and methods from one class into a "sub-class" or child class, and not have to re-write the code to make it work. <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->

subclass = child class<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
superclass = parent class<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->

--
# Encapsulation
- encapsulation == oop
- binding state(data) and behavior(operations on said data) into a single unit
- reduces dependencies, we can modify one class without impacting the rest of our program...theoretically
- achieved with access modifiers(`public`, `private`, `protected`) in Java.
